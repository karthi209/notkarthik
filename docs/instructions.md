2) the navbar text needs to be higlighted better for teh selcted one

4) sort doesnt work
5)in teh individual blog window, the post is slighly to teh left, also the article is below with teh back to thoughts lioooks like done without css
6) in my verse, remove the emoji and use the minil style used througout teh website, each category should be expandable. I was thinking more like the backlogs webiste wher eyou can back logs games, you can add photo rating and then large posts etc...
